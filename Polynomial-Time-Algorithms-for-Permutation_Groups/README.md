This is an implementation of the algorithm to prove Theorem 1 of the paper titled Polynomial Time Algorithms for Permutation Groups by Merrick Furst, John Hopcroft, Eugene Luks

The theorem states that given a set of generators for a permutaion group, one can find the coset representatives for the chain of subgroups that fixes elements in polynomial time. This is particularly useful to compute the group membership problem, i.e. making the group recognizable in polynomial time. 

There are many other algorithms introduced in the papers. They cover the normal closure of a subgroup and identifying generators of intersections of groups. These algorithms are not complicated (or very interesting to implement), however, they make good use of group theoretic properties concerning derived subgroups.

The goal of this randomized algorithm is to compute the expected value of the Longest Increasing Subsequence of a permutation of numbers. This problem appeared in a past year CS3230 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) exercise, and since I found it quite interesting, I inquired more of this. Thanks to Prof. Chang Yi Jun, who recommended me 'The Probabilistic Method' by Noga Alon, I have began working (reading) on more intriguing problems from there (from the book). In fact, the matrix permutation problem came from that book too!
